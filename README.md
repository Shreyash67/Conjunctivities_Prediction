# Conjunctivities Prediction Using Deep Learning
### üëÅÔ∏è Conjunctivitis Types (Pink Eye)
Conjunctivitis is an eye condition with three main types:

Allergic: Triggered by pollen/dust; causes watery discharge, swelling, and intense itching.

Bacterial: Caused by infection; leads to redness, thick yellow/green discharge, usually affects one eye.

Viral: Highly contagious; symptoms include redness, watery discharge, burning, and morning eyelid stickiness.

#### Non-Human Eye Detection

the model's prediction on an image of a dog, where the system identifies that the image does not contain a human eye. The model suggests trying again with a clearer image for accurate detection. This functionality ensures that the system only detects human eyes, enhancing the precision of the application.

#### Model Classification For Healthy and Infected Eye

the model correctly predicting the condition of two eye images. After detecting the human eye in both images, the model correctly classifying the images as either healthy or infected, demonstrating its accuracy in classifying eye conditions.
