# Conjunctivities Prediction Using Deep Learning
Conjunctivitis, commonly known as “pink eye,” is an ocular condition that can be classified into three primary types: allergic, bacterial, and viral (as shown in Figure 1). Each type presents distinct symptoms, which aid in accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
A healthy eye has a smooth, white sclera with faintly visible blood vessels that are not prominent unless closely examined. In contrast, conjunctivitis leads to inflammation, redness, and discomfort, which vary depending on the underlying cause.
1.
Allergic Conjunctivitis Allergic conjunctivitis is triggered by allergens such as pollen, dust mites, or pet dander. It is characterized by:
o
Watery discharge
o
Eye swelling
o
Intense itching
o
Frequently accompanied by sneezing and mucus buildup
2.
Bacterial Conjunctivitis Bacterial conjunctivitis results from bacterial infections and is typically more severe in one eye. Key symptoms include:
o
Redness and itching
o
Excessive tearing
o
Thick, white, yellow, or green discharge that reappears after wiping
3.
Viral Conjunctivitis Viral conjunctivitis, commonly caused by adenoviruses, is highly contagious and can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms include:
o
Redness, burning, and itching
o
Watery discharge
o
Eye pain and a foreign body sensation
o
Eyelid stickiness, particularly in the morning
